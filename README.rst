Django REST Framework Dynamic JWT
==========

Abstract
--------

Dynamic JWT is a fork of the Simple JWT library for Django REST Framework enabling custom authentication settings eg different public keys timeouts etc for different requests.

Existing programs are compatible and default authentication settings specified in your setting.py file under the label DYNAMIC_JWT can still be used

I have maintained all other features of the Simple JWT library as closely as possible, I am a big fan of the project.

How does this project differ to Simple JWT?
------------------------------------------



Dynamic JWT is a JSON Web Token authentication plugin for the `Django REST
Framework <http://www.django-rest-framework.org/>`__.

Do check out the Simple JWT docs as the settings used are the same as in Dynamic JWT `django-rest-framework-simplejwt.readthedocs.io
<https://django-rest-framework-simplejwt.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`__.
